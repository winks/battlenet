=========

Clojure library for Blizzard's Community Platform API.

Infos
-----
This is far from stable and just some remotely useful project while trying 
to dig into Clojure. It's probably ugly or even just plain wrong.

Setup
-----
core.clj has most of the useful stuff, with a few more in tools.clj.
Some API-reading functions in network.clj don't have wrappers yet.

Shouts
------
* [Blizzard Community API](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2626217/)
* Loosely based on [battlenet-python](https://github.com/vishnevskiy/battlenet)
* [This](http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html) and [this](http://moxleystratton.com/clojure/clojure-tutorial-for-the-non-lisp-programmer) helped me a lot
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) is simply awesome
* [Radagast](https://github.com/technomancy/radagast) told me that my coverage is not too bad.
